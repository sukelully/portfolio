          I'm a driven, detail-oriented full-stack developer with a background in Electronic
          Engineering and Music Technology Systems. I love building interactive, user-focused web
          appsâ€”combining creativity and technical precision. From real-time audio synthesis projects
          like Unwind Chimes to sleek, responsive interfaces in React, TypeScript, and Next.js, I
          bring ideas to life from concept to deployment. Feel free to reach out using my contact
